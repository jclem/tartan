# Tartan

tartan is a simple, flexible grid system packaged as a [Ruby gem](http://rubygems.org/gems/tartan-grid).

The primary goal of tartan is to create a grid that can be adapted to a diverse set of layout scenarios.

Where wrapping content in row containers is an options, tartan supports positioning content via floats. Where this is not possible, tartan supports positioning content via inline-block, eliminating the need to wrap content in row containers. This is especially useful in fluid/responsive layouts.

Currently, the best documentation is at [http://jclem.net/tartan](http://jclem.net/tartan).

## Thanks, Heroku

While I created and maintain this project, it was done while I was an employee
of [Heroku][heroku] on the Human Interfaces Team, and they were kind enough to
allow me to open source the work. Heroku is awesome.
